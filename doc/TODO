Here's a RailsCast on it: http://railscasts.com/episodes/
328-twitter-bootstrap-basics and Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial (http://
ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book) goes into some depth on
how to add it to your Rails app as well.

        consider removing the javascript stuff for now (no need to make
        end users download libraries they don't use)

        seed data for myself, kim and Jim?

        email address via seed data?

                email, for registering new accounts

        CanCan for runners, volunteers, race directors, etc.

========================================================================

        Mass Assignment issues in admin/users (tests succeed, but
        running the code doesn't)

========================================================================

        Make it so that autotest-fsevent and autotest-growl aren't needed
        where they don't exist

        admin/users Fix the birthday label

        Make the time-zone be a pull-down

        validate the time-zone

        use formtastic for the forms

        Document what is necessary to get the database working (or
        perhaps create a script)

========================================================================

        Finish setting up devise:

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here 
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment 
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. DONE

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
